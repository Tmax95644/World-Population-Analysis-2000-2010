Global Population Analysis (SQL)
Project Overview

This project analyzes global population data between 2000–2010 using SQL.
The goal is to explore population distribution, growth trends, extremes, and rankings across countries and continents using joins, aggregations, and window functions.

Core skills demonstrated:

Joins

Aggregations

Window functions (RANK, LAG)

Conditional aggregation

Trend analysis

Dataset

Tables used:

countries – country metadata (name, continent)

population_years – yearly population data by country

1️Data Exploration
Countries per Continent
SELECT
    c.continent,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.name) AS country_count
FROM countries c
JOIN population_years py
    ON c.id = py.country_id
GROUP BY c.continent
ORDER BY country_count DESC;


Result

Continent	Countries
Africa	56
Asia	51
Europe	40
North America	35
Oceania	17
South America	14
Average Population by Continent (2010)
SELECT
    c.continent,
    ROUND(AVG(py.population), 2) AS avg_population_2010
FROM countries c
JOIN population_years py
    ON c.id = py.country_id
WHERE py.year = 2010
GROUP BY c.continent
ORDER BY avg_population_2010 DESC;


Insight: Asia has by far the highest average population per country.

2️Top Countries by Population
Top 10 Most Populous Countries (2010)
SELECT
    c.name,
    py.population
FROM countries c
JOIN population_years py
    ON py.country_id = c.id
WHERE py.year = 2010
ORDER BY py.population DESC
LIMIT 10;


Result Highlights

China and India dominate global population totals

The United States ranks third, far behind Asia’s largest countries

Population Growth Trends
Dataset Year Range
SELECT DISTINCT year
FROM population_years;


Years covered: 2000–2010

Largest Population by Year
SELECT
    py.year,
    c.name,
    py.population
FROM population_years py
JOIN countries c
    ON c.id = py.country_id
WHERE (py.year, py.population) IN (
    SELECT year, MAX(population)
    FROM population_years
    GROUP BY year
)
ORDER BY py.year DESC;


Insight: China consistently has the largest population across all years.

Population Growth by Continent (2000–2010)
SELECT
    c.continent,
    (SUM(CASE WHEN py.year = 2010 THEN py.population END) -
     SUM(CASE WHEN py.year = 2000 THEN py.population END)) * 100.0 /
     SUM(CASE WHEN py.year = 2000 THEN py.population END)
     AS population_growth_percentage
FROM population_years py
JOIN countries c
    ON c.id = py.country_id
WHERE py.year IN (2000, 2010)
GROUP BY c.continent
ORDER BY population_growth_percentage DESC;


Key Findings

Africa experienced the highest growth rate

Europe showed slight population decline

Extremes in Population Change
Smallest Population Growth (2000–2010)
SELECT
    c.name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN py.year = 2000 THEN py.population END) AS pop_2000,
    SUM(CASE WHEN py.year = 2010 THEN py.population END) AS pop_2010,
    SUM(CASE WHEN py.year = 2010 THEN py.population END) -
    SUM(CASE WHEN py.year = 2000 THEN py.population END) AS population_change
FROM countries c
JOIN population_years py
    ON c.id = py.country_id
WHERE py.year IN (2000, 2010)
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY population_change ASC
LIMIT 10;


Insight: Several European countries experienced long-term population decline.

Highest Single-Year Growth
SELECT
    c.name,
    py.year,
    py.population,
    ROUND(
        ((py.population - LAG(py.population) OVER (PARTITION BY c.id ORDER BY py.year)) * 100.0) /
        LAG(py.population) OVER (PARTITION BY c.id ORDER BY py.year), 2
    ) AS growth_percentage
FROM population_years py
JOIN countries c
    ON c.id = py.country_id
ORDER BY growth_percentage DESC
LIMIT 1;


Result:
Montserrat recorded the highest single-year growth at 13.44% (2002).

Country Rankings by Continent (2010)
SELECT
    continent,
    name,
    population
FROM (
    SELECT
        c.continent,
        c.name,
        py.population,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY c.continent ORDER BY py.population DESC) AS rank
    FROM countries c
    JOIN population_years py
        ON c.id = py.country_id
    WHERE py.year = 2010
) ranked
WHERE rank <= 3
ORDER BY continent, rank;


Insight: Each continent is dominated by a small number of highly populous countries.

Global Population Growth Over Time
SELECT
    year,
    SUM(population) AS total_population
FROM population_years
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;


Key Trend

Global population increased steadily every year

Total growth from 2000–2010: ~754 million people
