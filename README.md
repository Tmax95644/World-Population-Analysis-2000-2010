World Population Analysis (2000–2010)
Project Overview

This project explores global population trends from 2000 to 2010 using SQL. The analysis focuses on population distribution, growth patterns, and country-level comparisons across continents. The goal is to demonstrate strong SQL querying skills, analytical thinking, and clear data storytelling suitable for a data analytics portfolio.

Key Questions Answered

How many countries are represented per continent?

What is the average population by continent?

Which countries are the most populous?

How has population changed over time?

Which regions experienced the fastest growth or decline?

How do countries rank within their continents?

Dataset Information

Tables Used:

countries — country name, continent, and unique ID

population_years — yearly population figures by country

Time Period: 2000–2010
Population Unit: Millions

Queries and Results

This section documents the final SQL queries used in the analysis along with their key results. These queries form the analytical backbone of the project and can be found in the /sql directory.

The data used in this project comes from a **Codecademy database**  used for educational purposes.

- The database was accessed directly via SQL
- Raw CSV files were not provided
- The dataset includes country metadata and yearly population figures (2000–2010)

Because the database is part of a closed learning environment,  
the raw source files are **not included in this repository**.
